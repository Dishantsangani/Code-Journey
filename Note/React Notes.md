📍 Topics 📍

1. What is React
   React is a JavaScript library that helps developers build user interfaces for websites. It's known for being simple and flexible, and is used by companies like Airbnb, Instagram, and Facebook

2. Why React
   It allows you to create complex user interfaces using “components,” or small, self-contained pieces of code.

3. Virtual Dom
   a lightweight copy of the real DOM that allows React to manage changes more efficiently by minimizing the direct manipulation required on the real DOM.

4. What is JSX?
   = Stands for JavaScript XML.
   = JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
   = JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

5. What is Props
   Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another.

6. What is a Component
   component is a piece of code That Can Reuse.

7. Function Component
   Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that take props as arguments and return JSX.

8. Class Component
   Class Component object oriented Classes with Functions you can use to render react components.

9. State
   React components has a built-in state object.
   The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component.
   When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

📍 Topics 📍

1. Higher Order Component
   HOC a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionality.

2. onChange
   React onChange is an event handler that triggers when there is any change in the input field

3. LazyLoading
   Lazy Loading in React JS helps to optimize the performance of React applications. The data is only rendered when visited or scrolled it can be images, scripts, etc.

📍 Hooks 📍
What Is a Hooks In React
▪ Hooks let you use different React features from your components
▪ A hook allows you to add functionality (like managing state or side effects) to your React components without using classes.

1. UseState
   ▪ Manage state in functional components.
   ▪ State is a Container to store data like variable.
   ▪ UseState Is Always use initialValue consider (Like, Object Array Int,Float).

2. UseEffect
   ▪ is like a "do something after rendering" hook.
   ▪ It runs after the component is rendered on the screen

3. UseCallback
   ▪ is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

4. UseLocation
   ▪ the useLocation hook provides access to the current location object

5. UseRef
   ▪ is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.

6. UseReducer
   ▪ is a React Hook that lets you add a reducer to your component.

7. UseMemo
   ▪ memo is a higher-order component provided by React, which aims to optimize the performance of React applications by reducing unnecessary re-rendering of components.

8. Usecontext
   ▪ allows components to consume state or context without the need for prop drilling

9. ContextAPI
   ▪ The Context API is a React feature that enables components to share values like user authentication, themes, or language settings across the entire app.

10. useLayoutEffect
    ▪ Similar to useEffect, but fires synchronously after layout changes.

11. useNavigate
    ▪ Programmatic navigation in React Router.

12. useParams
    ▪ Access route parameters dynamically.

13. useSearchParams
    ▪ Handle query strings in URLs.

14. Protected Routes
    ▪ Restrict access based on authentication
